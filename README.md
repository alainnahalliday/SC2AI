# s2client-api
StarCraft II Client - C++ library supported on Windows, Linux and Mac designed for building scripted bots and research using the SC2API.

Trying my hand at designing an SC2 bot using the API provided by Blizzard.
Starting out by scripting a Terran 2-1-1 strategy while I familiarize myself with the API and build helper systems that will be reused later. Afterwards I'll make matchup specific builds and implement reactive play (respond to opponent's decisions).
